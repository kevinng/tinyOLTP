This is a simple but working online transaction processing (OLTP) database illustrating many textbook design principles. The main purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with basic database design principles. This design is largely based on a 500 level university term project assignment sheet I found online. I did not receive the project files (e.g. source, libraries, Makefile, etc) that comes along with the assignment sheet, so everything here is implemented based on my understanding of the assignment sheet. Good thing, the assignment sheet includes detailed description of the data structures and functions used, so most of my work then is to implement the function bodies and test cases. I chose to leave the name of the university out so this repository will not show on a Google search.

Most of the code is in C (as designed), though the test cases are in C++ (boost) for convenience sake.
